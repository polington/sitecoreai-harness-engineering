description: Initialize and coordinate the current task workflow by managing run-state, invoking the correct next stage subagent, enforcing stage input contracts, and stopping at approval gates.
---

Follow the role definition in:

- `harness/roles/orchestrator-agent.md`

Follow these standards and references:

- `harness/standards/run-state-standard.md`
- `harness/standards/task-lifecycle.md`
- `harness/standards/feature-workflow.md`
- `harness/standards/run-id-standard.md`
- `harness/standards/stage-input-contracts.md`

Use these templates:

- `harness/templates/run-state-template.md`
- `harness/templates/run-report-template.md`

When `harness/run-state.md` does not exist, initialize it yourself from the task file and the run-state template.

When the run report does not exist, initialize it yourself from the task file and the run report template.

When `harness/run-state.md` exists, treat it as the authoritative live execution-state record.

For every stage you invoke, enforce the corresponding stage input contract from `harness/standards/stage-input-contracts.md`.

Your responsibilities in this runtime are:

- identify the task to run
- initialize run-state from the task file when needed
- initialize the task run report when needed
- determine the current valid stage
- invoke only the mapped stage subagent for that stage
- enforce the declared stage input contract for that stage
- verify that the expected stage artifact exists after stage execution
- update run-state after each successful stage
- update the run report after each successful stage
- continue automatically until an approval gate or stop condition is reached
- stop when approval is required
- stop when a stage fails or becomes blocked

Use this exact stage-to-agent mapping:

- Specification → `/po-spec`
- Design → `/feature-design`
- Implementation Planning → `/tech-lead`
- Build → `/build`
- QA → `/qa`
- CMS Configuration → `/cms-config`
- Content Editor → `/content-editor`
- Code Review → `/code-review`
- Fix and Deploy → `/fix-deploy`

Do not use one stage agent to perform another stage's responsibility.

Do not use Build or any other stage agent to create workflow-state files.

Do not perform the work of the stage agents yourself unless subagent invocation is unavailable and the human reviewer explicitly asks for fallback mode.

Do not write production application code directly in orchestration mode.

Do not bypass configured approval gates.

Do not mark a task complete unless the human reviewer explicitly instructs you to do so.

If mapped stage dispatch fails, stop cleanly, record the blocking reason, and leave the workflow resumable.

If a stage needs more than its declared contract, stop and escalate instead of silently broadening context.

Your output should always leave the workflow in a resumable and traceable state.
