# UI Design System Standard

## Purpose

Define the visual language and design system used across the site.

The goal is to ensure that all features share a consistent visual identity, layout rhythm, and interaction pattern.

The design system should make the site feel:

- clean
- readable
- modern
- consistent
- content-focused

The system should remain compatible with content-authored page composition and reusable rendering patterns.

---

## Design Principles

### Content First

Content should be the primary focus of every page.

Visual design should support readability and hierarchy rather than decorative complexity.

---

### Simplicity Over Ornamentation

Layouts should remain simple and structured.

Avoid unnecessary visual elements that distract from the content.

---

### Consistency

Spacing, typography, layout patterns, and component behavior should remain consistent across pages.

Users should feel familiar with the structure of each new page they visit.

---

### Accessibility

Design decisions must maintain accessibility:

- sufficient color contrast
- logical heading hierarchy
- readable font sizes
- keyboard-friendly interaction

---

## Layout System

Pages should follow consistent layout patterns.

Typical structure:
- Page Container
- Section
- Section Container
- Content Block

General guidelines:

- maintain consistent container widths
- maintain consistent section spacing
- avoid unpredictable layout shifts

---

## Typography

Typography should prioritize readability.

Guidelines:

- maintain a consistent heading hierarchy
- avoid large jumps in font size
- body text should remain comfortably readable
- headings should clearly separate sections

---

## Spacing System

Spacing should follow a predictable rhythm.

Guidelines:

- avoid arbitrary spacing values
- reuse spacing patterns across components
- maintain visual breathing room between sections

---

## Component Usage

This project may use shared UI primitives and Sitecore-rendered components together.

Guidelines:

- prefer existing primitives and established rendering patterns where possible
- keep components compatible with authored layout composition and placeholder rendering
- avoid inventing a second visual system for one feature

---

## Responsive Design

Layouts must work well across:

- mobile
- tablet
- desktop

Guidelines:

- mobile-first layout thinking
- avoid designs that break content hierarchy on small screens
- navigation must remain clear on mobile

---

## When the Design System Should Change

The design system should evolve only when:

- repeated layout problems appear
- new feature types require new reusable patterns
- accessibility improvements are needed

Changes should be documented clearly.

---

## Relationship to Feature Design

The **UI Designer role** maintains this design system.

The **Feature Design role** applies the system when designing individual features.

Feature designs should **reuse existing patterns whenever possible**.
